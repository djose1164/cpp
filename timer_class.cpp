/*
4-1. Create a struct TimerClass. In its constructor, record the current time
in a field called timestamp (compare with the POSIX function gettimeofday).

4-2. In the destructor of TimerClass, record the current time and subtract the
time at construction. This time is roughly the age of the timer. Print this value.

4-3. Implement a copy constructor and a copy assignment operator for TimerClass.
The copies should share timestamp values.

4-4. Implement a move constructor and a move assignment operator for TimerClass.
A moved-from TimerClass shouldnâ€™t print any output to the console when it gets destructed.

4-5. Elaborate the TimerClass constructor to accept an additional const char* name parameter.
When TimerClass is destructed and prints to stdout, include the name of the timer in the output.

4-6. Experiment with your TimerClass. Create a timer and move it into a function
that performs some computationally intensive operation (for example, lots of math in a loop).
Verify that your timer behaves as you expect.

4-7. Identify each method in the SimpleString class (Listing 4-38). Try reimplementing it
 from scratch without referring to the book.
